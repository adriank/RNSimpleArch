# React Native Simple Architecture

## Why

This architecture allows developers to create apps in no time. It has scripts to add views and functionalities to the code without writting too much code.

## Instalation

There is one simple script to create an app:

`sh createProject.sh lowercasename`

where *lowercasename* is the name of the project (this is what package.json *name* field recommends).

## Usage

There are following scripts to make your life easier:

### createReducer

Creates boilerplate to add functionality to your app.

`yarn createReducer underline_separated_lower_case_name`

### createContainer

Creates a React component aware of the state.
